GAME ITSELF

	player fires, put timer to limit
		reset when trigger is released
		if maintained, continue shooting

		stance radians, random horizontal and vertical shots
			horizontal moves plane
			vertical moves pitch z
		add a pitch z_mod for shots, like jumps but it overflows and jumping continues
		place a z_mod cap
	enemies must check collisions like the player as they move


RENDERING, walls/sprites are being rendered backwards, try to make it render forward to improve caching

parsing:
	check doors on parsing, put sprites on parsing

compass:
	print a couple of dda lines

hud:
	find a weapon
	when zooming, scale the weapon but do not change weapon position
	introduce weapon sway, do not rotate weapon, bad performance
	weapon tex_regular, render line by line depending on position
	weapon swing up and down and horizontally
	use sinf calculated for walking

enemies:
	raycast to check if the enemy sees you from their center position
	make it simple, enemies chase you if they have direct line of sight

mlx:
	change everything to mlx

extras:
	revise doors, store z_buffer
	check door collisions
	pathfinding A*, ui....
	bullet holes
	iluminação
