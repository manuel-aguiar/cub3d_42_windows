parsing:
	check doors on parsing, put sprites on parsing

compass:
	print a couple of dda lines

hud:
	find a weapon
	when zooming, scale the weapon but do not change weapon position
	introduce weapon sway, do not rotate weapon, bad performance
	weapon tex_regular, render line by line depending on position
	weapon swing up and down and horizontally
	use sinf calculated for walking

shot mechanics:
	close to done

	
rendering:
	adjust heights of doors and scale sprites appropritely

enemies:
	raycast to check if the enemy sees you from their center position
	make it simple, enemies chase you if they have direct line of sight

	enemy hit: distance less than (player radius + enemy radius)
	use an overflow timer to limit the number of attacks per second, per sprite

mlx:
	change everything to mlx

extras:
	revise doors, store z_buffer
	check door collisions
	bullet holes
	iluminação
