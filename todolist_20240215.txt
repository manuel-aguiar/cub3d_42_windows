parsing:
	check doors on parsing, put sprites on parsing

compass:
	print a couple of dda lines

hud:
	find a weapon
	when zooming, scale the weapon but do not change weapon position
	introduce weapon sway, do not rotate weapon, bad performance
	weapon tex_regular, render line by line depending on position
	weapon swing up and down and horizontally
	use sinf calculated for walking



shot mechanics:
	shot collision, enemies are flat against me, use position + unit size to determine their position
	their plane is parallel to camera plane, perpdist is the same across the character
	first:
		if the shot hit horizontally via unit size, check vertically via player pitch angle, player height, sprite z_place and sprite z_height
	

enemies:
	raycast to check if the enemy sees you from their center position
	make it simple, enemies chase you if they have direct line of sight

	enemy hit: distance less than (player radius + enemy radius)
	use an overflow timer to limit the number of attacks per second, per sprite


mlx:
	change everything to mlx



extras:
	revise doors, store z_buffer
	check door collisions
	iluminação
